# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## description

this app was developed to help users know what to wear depending on the temparataure and condition outside.
It allows users to add their own items and select in what category they would like it to appear in.

### technicques and skills

I used routes to be able to make the app alot smoother when transitioning pages,
i utilized error handling to be able to show in the app when its not functioning or info is missing.
I used my backend skills to develop smooth sign in/signup functions for the user.
